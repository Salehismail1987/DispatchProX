                            <p>We are a platform for entities using trucks, truck brokers, trucking companies, and for drivers. Our truck job platform provides common processes for managing and tracking the truck jobs between the different entities and actors. We provide you software (the &ldquo;<strong>Software</strong>&rdquo;), that you access remotely via the cloud, that you can use for (a) managing your Truck Jobs (&ldquo;<strong>Truck Job Platform</strong>&rdquo;); and generating DispatchProX tickets (collectively &ldquo;<strong>Tickets</strong>&rdquo;) from the data you and others provide to generate outputs for your business like, but not limited to, invoices, bills, work schedules, and business insights.</p>

                            <p>The information, Truck Job Platform, and Tickets provided when using the Services are not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

                            <h3><a name="_Toc115022328">Using DispatchProX Tickets</a></h3>

                            <p>DispatchProX Tickets have the following lifecycle statuses; Pending, Accepted, Driving, Completed, and Approved. When a ticket is Approved, it is considered used, the ticket becomes a closed ticket.</p>

                            <p>You may use Tickets (in any lifecycle) generated by the Software for your business or organization. It is your responsibility to determine whether the Tickets generated by the Software are appropriate for your use. From time to time, we may notify you that a particular Ticket may need to be updated in response to changes in applicable laws or other guidance, rules, requirements, or regulations, and you are responsible for determining whether to update the Tickets used in your business or organization.</p>

                            <p><strong>WE DO NOT REPRESENT THAT THE TICKETS WILL MEET YOUR SPECIFIC GOALS, PROTECT YOUR SPECIFIC INTERESTS, OR WITHSTAND CHALLENGES TO THEIR LEGAL OR FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY. THE TICKETS ARE NOT PROVIDED WITH ANY GUARANTEE, WARRANTY, OR REPRESENTATION AS TO QUALITY OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. </strong></p>

                            <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that DispatchProX will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the Service will require the Service to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but DispatchProX cannot take responsibility for the Service not working at full functionality if you don&rsquo;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&rsquo;t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

                            <p>If you&rsquo;re using the Service outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the Service, or other third-party charges. In using the Service, you&rsquo;re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Service outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you&rsquo;re using the Service, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the Service.</p>

                            <p>If you&rsquo;re using the Service via Mobile phone, you should interact with the Service only when it is safe to do so. You should not interact with the service when you are driving a truck or any other vehicle.</p>

However, the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that you are tax exempt, provided you give us a valid tax exemption certificate within thirty (30) days of the start of your Subscription. Our failure to include any applicable tax in an invoice will not waive or dismiss the parties&rsquo; rights or obligations according to this Section. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of Sales Taxes or any other tax or duty, you shall separately pay us the withheld or deducted amount, over and above fees due.
